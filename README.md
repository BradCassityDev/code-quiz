## Random Password Generator

## Overview:
This project was built for the purposes of quizing programmers to test their knowledge in programming. Once the quiz starts, a timer is started that counts down from 60 giving the user 60 seconds to complete the timed quiz. Each question they get incorrect will result in a deduction of 10 seconds from their current time remaining. If time runs out, the quiz ends and you get a zero. Points are an exact representation of how much time the user had remaining at the end of the quiz.

## Built With:
* HTML
* CSS
* Javascript

## Usage:
Users can test their knowledge on current programming standards by taking a timed quiz to analyse their results and stack them up against others.
